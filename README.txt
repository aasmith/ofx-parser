== DESCRIPTION:

ofx-parser is a ruby library to parse a realistic subset of the lengthy OFX 1.x specification.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Reads OFX responses - i.e. those downloaded from financial institutions and
  puts it into a usable object graph.
* Supports the 3 main message sets: banking, credit card and investment
  accounts, as well as the required 'sign on' set.
* Knows about SIC codes - if your institution provides them.
  See http://www.eeoc.gov/stats/jobpat/siccodes.html
* Monetary amounts can be retrieved either as a raw string, or in pennies.
* Supports OFX timestamps.

== SYNOPSIS:

Supports bank accounts:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'ofx-parser'

  ofx = OfxParser::OfxParser.parse(open("bank-statement.ofx"))
  bank_acct = ofx.bank_accounts.first

  bank_acct.number # => '103333333333'
  bank_acct.routing_number # => '033000033'
  bank_acct.balance # => '123.45'
  bank_acct.balance_in_pennies # => 12345

  bank_acct.statement.start_date # => DateTime
  bank_acct.statement.end_date # => DateTime

  bank_acct.statement.transactions.size # => 4

  bank_acct.statement.transactions.first.payee # => "FOO, INC."
  bank_acct.statement.transactions.first.type # => :DEBIT
  bank_acct.statement.transactions.first.amount # => '-11.11'
  bank_acct.statement.transactions.first.amount_in_pennies # => -1111

Also supports credit cards...

  ofx = OfxParser::OfxParser.parse(open("creditcard-statement.ofx"))
  credit_card = ofx.credit_accounts.first

  credit_card.remaining_credit # => '19000.0'
  credit_card.remaining_credit_in_pennies # => '1900000'

  credit_card.statement.start_date # => DateTime
  credit_card.statement.end_date # => DateTime

  credit_card.statement.transactions.size # => 10

  credit_card.statement.transactions.first.type # => :DEBIT
  credit_card.statement.transactions.first.amount # => '-19.17'
  credit_card.statement.transactions.first.amount_in_pennies # => '-1917'
  credit_card.statement.transactions.first.sic # => '7933'
  credit_card.statement.transactions.first.sic_desc # => 'BOWLING CENTERS'
  credit_card.statement.transactions.first.payee # => 'SUNSET BOWLING'
